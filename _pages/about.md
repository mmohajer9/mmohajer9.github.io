I'm Mohammad Mahdi Mohajer. I enjoy developing and maintaining software systems and web applications.
I used to build up software projects with many technologies (including both client-side and server-side and etc.) but finally i found my way in developing server-side applications and now i gathered my entire focus on Software Testing and Cloud Computing.
There's certainly yet more to learn , yet more problems to solve , yet more to build and yet more places to make them better.
